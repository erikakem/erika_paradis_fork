**PARADIS**: **P**hysically inspired **A**dvection, **R**eaction **A**nd **DI**ffusion on the **S**phere

#### Key Features

- **Physically-informed neural architecture:** Combines convolutional neural networks with operators akin to the advection, diffusion, and reaction (ADR) equation to handle complex physical phenomena.
- **Spherical Semi-Lagrangian advection operator:** Enables the non-local transformation of information in spherical coordinates.
- **Geocyclic Padding:** Addresses the challenge of representing the Earth’s spherical geometry

#### Dependencies
Necessary python packages can be installed using **pip**:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Usage
##### Training
For training, the `paradis_settings.yaml` file in the `config/` directory is used to manage inputs
```
python train.py [override_args]
```
where `[override_args]` can override the inputs in the config file.


##### Inference
For inference, use `forecast.py` and provide the appropriate config file as a first argument, for example
```
python forecast.py config/paradis_settings.yaml
```

#### Dataset

Download the original dataset from WeatherBench 2:

```
cd scripts
bash download_dataset.sh OUTPUT_DIR
```
where OUTPUT_DIR is the destination directory and then preprocess it

```
python scripts/preprocess_weatherbench_data.py -i /path/to/ERA5/5.625deg_wb2 -o /path/to/ERA5/5.65deg
```
